This is a set of codes that allow for modulus squared calculations for Compton scatterign and electron positron annihilation into two photons, mediated by a massive spin 2 boson, which we identify with the X resonance at 17 MeV found by the ATOMKI and JINR collaborations independently.

Fermion polarizations have been summed. Spin 2 polarizations have been summed. Photon polarizations have not been summed.

To execute code, install FORM on your device, and simply type at command line:

form <filename.frm>

execution might take a couple of minutes...
